Subject: Request for No Objection Certificate to Pursue Ph.D. (Part-Time)

Dear [HR/Manager’s Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to formally request the organization’s consent to pursue a Ph.D. degree under the part-time mode at Annamalai University. As part of the university’s admission requirements, I am required to submit a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from my employer confirming support for my academic engagement alongside regular employment.

This program will not interfere with my professional responsibilities and I assure you of continued commitment to my role. The university may require occasional deputation for course work and research-related activities.

Kindly consider my request and facilitate the issuance of the NOC as per the attached format provided by the university.

Thank you for your support and consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your Full Name]
[Employee ID]
[Department/Team]
